# ProctAssign
A program to assign proctors to rooms based on their schedule

#Mr. Fein
The most current version of the source code is under the GreeleyScheduler directory source
The ProctAssign Foler (and netbeans project) is not in use anymore because GreeleyScheduler is a cleaner
and more consise grouping of code however GreeleyScheduler does lack the "MasterSchedule" which exists in ProctAssign/src

I have not had time to put it into "GreeleyScheduler" but I will soon as well as a way to read/write the data from/to a file so
the school wouldn't have to input everything in by hand.

What I need your help most is deciding how to decide when sections should meet and which teachers are teaching them based on the 
constraints I had mentioned in the email.

Thanks!
