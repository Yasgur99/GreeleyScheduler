# ProctAssign
A program to assign proctors to rooms based on their schedule
The most current version of the source code is under the GreeleyScheduler directory source
The ProctAssign Foler (and netbeans project) is not in use anymore because GreeleyScheduler is a cleaner and more consise grouping of code
