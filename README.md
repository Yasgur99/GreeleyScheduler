# GreeleyScheduler
A program created for Horace Greeley High school to handle the formation
of the Master Schedule. This program handles the parsing of Excel files
containing the courses offered, teachers who teach those courses, and 
constraints of the teachers. I am working with HGHS staff to learn more
about the requirements and constraints of the schedule. This program 
uses a genetic algorithm in order to determine the schedule. After a
valid schedule is found, it will be outputed in a text file formated
by the standards of Infinite Campus. Eventually, I hope that this program 
will be able to automate the input of the schedule into Infinite Campus
so the HGHS staff does not have to do it by hand.

I have created this project in an attempt to save the HGHS staff from creating
the master schedule using trial and error using a room full of velcro and 
slips of paper containing teacher names and course names.
